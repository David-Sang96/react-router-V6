The bed was large and very comfortable and I like the colour and the decor in the room. It was very tastefully done and to me, many will like it. I found the Reception Staff very friendly, fast and obliging. I was very happy to be given a late check-out after my small request. My girl friend and I was very happy and pleased with one day stay. Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Had to return for work!"
